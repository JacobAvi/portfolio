## Initial Design Draft

I personally enjoy the old-modern combination of poster used within the Fallout series and the game 'Bioshock: Infinite'. 

The initial collection of images picked for this style of website were very complex, especially for my current ability of CSS. I decided that the colours were still quite attractive, but I would simplify the design greatly.


## Colors & Design

I started using a very minimalist color theme with different shades of grey. This was quite boring as the website itself has very little content. In hindsight beginning with just these shades and concentrating on design would have been more beneficial to get a better design done quicker, considering the time constraints.

I found a nice color scheme from a watch on pintrest also. I never tried this but it's featured above.


I then tried a cooler feel with some dark shades of blue with one light shade, which just came off as very monotone.

The last color that I ended up using was a shade of some light and dark greens, which feel very calming. I got this design from a UI/UX prototype I found on pinterest. This was my main inspiration for most of my design.

The green ended up being way too much dark for the background. Thinking about doing some sort of change up of color halfway down the page, maybe some warmer colors (orange? red? purple?) and not having green at all. This is an invetible change, the green is pretty gross on a full screen.

Here were some drafts messing around with colors that I ended up liking but the colors were too crazy and didn't go together that well.

And here is a theme that I will be revisiting as I really liked the off-center style. The background color was also not so green, which actually looks a lot better than the deep green Iv'e used. Also it was just easier to make everything centered in the short term, so I went with that, especially because I didn't have any good ideas of how the website would expand into a desktop site.

## Fonts 
I wanted to have a classical feel at the beginning of the website for fonts, with a more very readable more modern font throughout the paragraph text. 

My idea changed quite quick when 

Some combinations of classical modern that I used as a draft are:

* Renault Light + Apex New

* Playfair Display SC + Montserrat

After the first few drafts of design, the serif fonts just did not suit the style of my website, and I decided to go for a more playful / cartoony font for my main headings. I found Changa One very quickly and gravitated towards that for the rest of the design.

__Changa One & Montserrat__ -- This was the best looking combination for my liking.

## HTML and CSS development
The starting goal for the website was to have all simple features in before the styling began. I found that as time went on, simple styling to have a feel of how it would look early on would help with a general look as I went.

I had a simple design to begin with in Figma, because I wasn't sure if my CSS could hold up to something very complicated.

My HTML and CSS in the end result is fairly messy and there's plenty of repeated code that I'm aware can be put into classes and reused much more efficiently.

I'm excited to make this website better throughout the coming weeks as I could have tested my ability to master CSS much harder.
